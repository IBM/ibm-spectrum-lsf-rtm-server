	>**Developer Certificate of Origin**
	>
	>This repository uses a [modified Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-spectrum-lsf-rtm-server/blob/main/IBMDCO.md) 1.1 and use a "sign-off" procedure on patches that are being emailed around or contributed in any other way.
	>
	>Contributors sign-off that they adhere to these requirements by adding a Signed-off-by line to commit messages.
	>
	>```log
	>This is my commit message
	>
	>Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.>example.org>
	>```
	>
	>Git even has a -s command line option to append this automatically to your commit message:
	>
	>```shell
	>$ git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'
	>```
	>
