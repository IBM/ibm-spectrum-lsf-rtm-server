<h1 id="automation-tree-rules">Automation Tree Rules</h1>
<p>This section will describe <strong>Tree Rules</strong> in Cacti.</p>
<p>Tree rules allow Automation to bunch up devices based on matches on rules we come up with you can say bunch all Cisco devices on to a Cisco tree. Or if you have a site where all of the hostnames start with siteb you can have a site b tree etc see below for some examples.</p>
<p>To get started you will need to create a Tree rule on the top right click the + to start a new rule you are also able to duplicate rules to make it easier as well.</p>

<p>We need a way to tell automation what device we are looking for in the example above we are looking for a device with the hostname Linux this is done via a REGEX any perl based REGEX can be used.</p>
<p>To test this REGEX on existing devices you can click the show eligible Objects this will check the Devices currently in cacti for a match.</p>
<p><img src="images/automation-tree-rules-edit4.png" alt="Tree Rules Preview" /></p>
<p>Once a device is a match it will be placed on the default tree. To change which tree the device will be placed on simply select the tree name from the dropdown list.</p>

<p>We also have the option to auto create a tree based on our rule in this case a new tree Named Linux will be created if it does not already exist.</p>
