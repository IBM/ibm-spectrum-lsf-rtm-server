<p><img src="images/cacti_system_utilities.JPG" alt="System Utilities" />.</p>
<p>Some of the most important tools are listed below</p>
<h3 id="rebuild-poller-cache">Rebuild poller cache</h3>
<p>The Poller Cache will be re-generated if you select this option. Use this option only in the event of a database crash if you are experiencing issues after the crash and have already run the database repair tools. Alternatively, if you are having problems with a specific Device, simply re-save that Device to rebuild its Poller Cache. There is also a command line interface equivalent to this command that is recommended for large systems. NOTE: On large systems, this command may take several minutes to hours to complete and therefore should not be run from the Cacti UI. You can simply run 'php -q cli/rebuild_poller_cache.php --help' at the command line for more information.</p>
<h3 id="technical-support">Technical support</h3>
<p>Cacti technical support page. Used by developers and technical support persons to assist with issues in Cacti. Includes checks for common configuration issues.</p>
<h3 id="rrd-cleaner">RRD cleaner</h3>
<p>When you delete Data Sources from Cacti, the corresponding RRDfiles are not removed automatically. Use this utility to facilitate the removal of these old files.</p>
