<h1 id="system-utilities">System Utilities</h1>
<p>This section will describe <strong>System Utilities</strong> in Cacti.</p>
<p>The system utilities page in cacti contains tools used for administering cacti from this page you can do the following</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Rebuild poller cache.</p></li>
<li><p>View technical support information.</p></li>
<li><p>Adjust log settings.</p></li>
<li><p>View the user log for audits.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/system-utilities.png" alt="System Utilities" />.</p>
<p>Some of the most important tools are listed below</p>
<h2 id="rebuild-poller-cache">Rebuild poller cache</h2>
<p>The Poller Cache will be re-generated if you select this option. Use this option only in the event of a database crash if you are experiencing issues after the crash and have already run the database repair tools. Alternatively, if you are having problems with a specific Device, simply re-save that Device to rebuild its Poller Cache. There is also a command line interface equivalent to this command that is recommended for large systems. NOTE: On large systems, this command may take several minutes to hours to complete and therefore should not be run from the Cacti UI. You can simply run 'php -q cli/rebuild_poller_cache.php --help' at the command line for more information.</p>
<h3 id="technical-support">Technical support</h3>
<p>Cacti technical support page. Used by developers and technical support persons to assist with issues in Cacti. Includes checks for common configuration issues. There is also built-in checks that help you tune your Cacti installation.</p>
<p>For example in the technical support section under the summary, you will see a calculation for how many MySQL connections. You should have (Cacti 1.2.16+) you will also show poller information such as the last polling time process count and more detailed info that can be used for a quick view of how the system is configured.</p>
<p><img src="images/system-utilities-poller.png" alt="System Utilities" />.</p>
<p>You will also see all of the system variables such as allocated php memory as well as mysql variables.</p>
<p><img src="images/system-utilities-db.png" alt="System Utilities" /></p>
<p>Any Variable appearing in red indicates a subpar setting and should be looked. the recommendations are dynamic in that they change when more system resources are detected so if you upgrade your server hardware be sure to check back to this page to get the most out of your new hardware.</p>
<h3 id="rrd-cleaner">RRD cleaner</h3>
<p><code>Console &gt; utilities &gt; System Utilities &gt; RRDfile Cleaner</code></p>
<p>When you delete Data Sources from Cacti, the corresponding RRDfiles are not removed automatically. Use this utility to facilitate the removal of these old files.</p>
<p>In system utilities you can manually start the RRD cleaning procedure You can either archive the selected RRD's to have them deleted in the next polling cycle</p>
<p><img src="images/system-utilities-rrdcleaner.png" alt="System Utilities" /></p>
<p>RRDfiles can also be schedule to automatically be removed this option can be configured in <code>Console &gt; Configuration &gt; Settings &gt; Paths</code> by selecting the RRDfile autoclean selection.</p>

<h3 id="rrdfile-checker">RRDfile Checker</h3>
<p><code>Console &gt; utilities &gt; System Utilities &gt; RRDfile Checker</code></p>
<p>The RRDfile checker is a tool that scans all RRDfiles at a scheduled time and tests the stored data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stale values for 1 or 24 hours</li>
<li>Whether the file is updated regularly</li>
<li>Incorrect file read/write access</li>
<li>Whether the Database Data Source objects match the RRDfiles Data Sources</li>
</ul>
<p>For very large Cacti installs the <strong>RRDfile checker</strong> can take quite a long time to complete. You can set number of concurrent parallel processes in <code>Console &gt; Configuration &gt; Settings &gt; Data</code></p>
<h3 id="viewing-change-log-from-system-utilities">Viewing Change log from system utilities</h3>
