<h1 id="version-specific-release-notes">Version Specific Release Notes</h1>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Below you will find the release note for all versions of Cacti 1.0.0 and above. Release notes for earlier Cacti versions have been excluded due to the large list of changes that have occurred over the years, and since Cacti 0.8.x is no longer supported, it's a good time to for the purposes of this document, move them aside.</p>
<p>Before that list, let's talks about Cacti 1.0.0 first.</p>
<h2 id="cacti-100">Cacti 1.0.0</h2>
<p>This was the initial release of Cacti 1.x. With the release of Cacti 1.0.0 many improvements and enhancements have been made. As part of ongoing efforts to improve Cacti almost 20 plugins were merged into the core of Cacti eliminating the need for the plugins. A major refresh of the interface has been started and will continue to occur as development on Cacti continues.</p>
<h3 id="plugins-integrated-into-cacti-core">Plugins integrated into Cacti Core</h3>
