<h1 id="templates">Templates</h1>
<p>The real strength of Cacti is unleashed by using templates. There are three different types of templates with the basic Cacti installation: <strong>Data Templates</strong>, <strong>Graph Templates</strong>, <strong>Device Templates</strong>, <strong>Aggregate Templates</strong>, and <strong>Color Templates</strong>. While it is perfectly fine to define all data sources and graphs without using Templates at all, the burden of this approach is high. In most installations, there are lots of devices of the same kind. And there are lots of data of the same kind, e.g. traffic information is needed for almost every device. Therefore, the parameters needed to create a traffic RRD file are defined by a <em>Data Template</em>, in this case known as "Interface - Traffic". These definitions are used by all Traffic-related RRD files.</p>
<p>The same approach is used for defining <strong>Graph Templates</strong>. This is done only once. And all parameters defined within such a <strong>Graph Template</strong> are copied to all <strong>Graphs</strong> that are created using this Template.</p>
<p>The last type of Templates are the <strong>Device Templates</strong>. They are not related to some RRDTool stuff. The purpose of <strong>Device Templates</strong> is to group all <strong>Graph Templates</strong> and <strong>Data Queries</strong> (these are explained later) for a given device type. So you will make up a <strong>Device Template</strong> e.g. for a specific type of router, switch, host and the like. By assigning the correct <strong>Device Template</strong> to each new <strong>Device</strong>, you'll never forget to create all needed <strong>Graphs</strong>.</p>
<p>There's no need to create all Templates on your own! Apart from the fact, that many common templates are provided out-of-the-box, there's a very simple mechanism to <strong>Import Templates</strong> and to <strong>Export Templates</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="data-templates">Data Templates</h2>
<p>In Cacti, a <strong>Data Template</strong> provides a skeleton for an actual <strong>Data Source</strong>. If you have many <strong>Data Sources</strong> that share most of their characteristics, using a <strong>Data Template</strong> would probably make sense. No change of a <strong>Data Template</strong> is propagated to already existing RRD files. But most of them may be changed by using <code>rrdtool tune</code> from command line. Pay attention to not append new <em>Data Source Items</em> to already existing RRD files. There's no <code>rrdtool</code> command to achieve this!</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-data-template">Creating a Data Template</h3>
<p>To create a new <strong>Data Template</strong>, select <strong>Data Templates</strong> under the **Console</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Templates** menu heading and click Add.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first thing you must do is give the template a name. This name has nothing to do with the <strong>Data Source</strong> name, but is what you will use to identify the template throughout Cacti.</p>
<p>Second, you will notice a list of data source/data source item field names with Use Per-Data Source Value checkboxes next to each one. The nice thing about templates in Cacti is that you can choose whether to template each field on a per-field basis. If you leave the checkbox unchecked, every data source attached to the template will inherit its value from the template. If the checkbox is checked, every data source attached to the template will contain its own value for that particular field. When generating a real data source, you will be prompted to fill those non-templated fields.</p>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Associated RRAs</td>
<td>You need to associate the data source with at least one RRA so RRDTool knows how often and for how long to keep its data. You will almost always want to select all of these values however so you can render daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly graphs.</td>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For most data templates, you will want to check the Use Per-Graph Value checkbox for the name field so each data source using this template has its own unique name. It also makes sense to enter an initial value in this field that includes the variable <code>|host_description|</code> for organizational purposes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you are finished filling in values for the data template, click Create and you will be presented with a screen similar to the data source edit screen.</p>
<p><img src="images/data-template.png" alt="Adding a Data Template" /></p>
<h4 id="data-source-items">Data Source Items</h4>
<p>Like a graph, a data source can have more than one items. This is useful in situations where a script returns more than piece of data at one time. This also applies to data queries, so you can have a single data template that contains both inbound and outbound traffic, rather than having to create a separate data template for each.</p>

The COUNTER data source assumes that the counter never decreases, except when a counter overflows. It is always a whole INTEGER, floating point numbers are invalid. The update function takes the overflow into account. The counter is stored as a per-second rate. When the counter overflows, RRDTool checks if the overflow happened at the 32bit or 64bit border and acts accordingly by adding an appropriate value to the result. GAUGE: numbers that are not continuously incrementing, e.g. a temperature reading. Floating point numbers are accepted. ABSOLUTE: counters that are reset upon reading. DERIVE: like COUNTER but without overflow checks</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Heartbeat</td>
<td>As defined by RRDTool: "The maximum amount of time that can pass before data is entered as "unknown". This field is usually '600' or 2 data gathering intervals".</td>

</table>
<h4 id="custom-data">Custom Data</h4>
<p>Assuming you selected a data input source on the previous screen, you should now be presented with a Custom Data box. It will show a single line for every single parameter required for that very data input method. This is how the Data Source glues together with the data input method to provide all run time parameters.</p>
<p>Each custom data field is per-field templatable as all of the other data source fields are. Even if you select the Use Per-Data Source Value checkbox, it might be useful to specify a value that will be used as an "inital value" for any data source using this data template.</p>
<h3 id="applying-data-templates-to-data-sources">Applying Data Templates to Data Sources</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When changing parameters of a Data Template, existing RRD files will never be changed. If this is required, you will have to apply <code>rrdtool tune</code> commands to any related RRD file manually.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Applying a data template to a data source is a very simple process. The first thing you must do is select the data source you want to apply the template to under Data Sources. Under the Data Template Selection box, select the data template that you want to apply to the data source and click Save.</p>
<p>Once the template is applied to the data source, you will notice that you can only change values for the fields that you checked Use Per-Data Source Value for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Now any time a change is made to the data template, it will be automatically propagated to the data sources attached to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="walkthrough-my-first-data-template">Walkthrough: My First Data Template</h4>
<p>For this task, let's stick to SNMP stuff. For you to be able to reproduce this example, I've chosen the <strong>UDP</strong> information of the IP MIB.</p>
<pre class="console"><code>snmpwalk -c &lt;community string&gt; -v1 &lt;device&gt; udp
UDP-MIB::udpInDatagrams.0 = Counter32: 7675
UDP-MIB::udpNoPorts.0 = Counter32: 128
UDP-MIB::udpInErrors.0 = Counter32: 0
UDP-MIB::udpOutDatagrams.0 = Counter32: 8406
</code></pre>
<p>As cacti does not use the MIBs but pure ASN.1 OIDs, let's search the OID used as <code>udpInDatagrams</code>:</p>
<pre class="console"><code>snmpwalk -c &lt;community string&gt; -v1 -On &lt;device&gt; udp
.1.3.6.1.2.1.7.1.0 = Counter32: 7778
.1.3.6.1.2.1.7.2.0 = Counter32: 129
.1.3.6.1.2.1.7.3.0 = Counter32: 0
.1.3.6.1.2.1.7.4.0 = Counter32: 8514
</code></pre>
<p>The needed OID is .1.3.6.1.2.1.7.1.0. Now learn how to enter this into a new Cacti Data Template: Please proceed to Data Templates and filter for SNMP. Check the SNMP - Generic OID Template</p>
<p><img src="images/data-templates.png" alt="Data Templates" /></p>
<p>After clicking Go, you're prompted with a new page to enter the name for the new Data Template:</p>
<p><img src="images/data-templates-copy.png" alt="Data Templates Duplicate" /></p>
<p>Due to the filter defined above, you won't see the new Template at once, so please enter udp as a new filter to find:</p>
<p><img src="images/data-templates-new.png" alt="Data Templates New" /></p>
<p>Now select this entry to change some definitions according to the following images:</p>
<p><img src="images/data-templates-new1.png" alt="Data Templates New 1" /></p>
<p><img src="images/data-templates-new2.png" alt="Data Templates New 2" /></p>
<p>for the lower one. Please pay attention to change the MAXIMUM value to 0 to prevent data suppression for values exceeding 100. And you saw the OID <code>.1.3.6.1.2.1.7.1.0</code> from above, didn't you? Please copy another one for OID <code>.1.3.6.1.2.1.7.4.0</code>, using the description <strong>udpOutDatagrams</strong></p>
<h2 id="graph-templates">Graph Templates</h2>
<p>In Cacti, a graph template provides a skeleton for an actual graph. If you have many graphs that share most of their characteristics, using a graph template would probably make sense. After a graph is attached to a particular graph template, all changes made to the graph template will propagate out to all of its graphs, unless Use Per-Graph Value has been checked.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-graph-template">Creating a Graph Template</h3>
<p>To create a new graph template, select Graph Templates under the Templates heading and click Add.</p>
<p>The first thing you must do is give the template a name. This name has nothing to do with the graph title, but is what you will use to identify the template throughout Cacti. Second, you will notice a list of graph field names with Use Per-Graph Value checkboxes next to each one. The nice thing about templates in Cacti is that you can choose whether to template each field on a per-field basis.

<h3 id="applying-graph-templates-to-graphs">Applying Graph Templates to Graphs</h3>
<p>Applying a graph template to a graph is a very simple process. The first thing you must do is select the graph you want to apply the template to under Graph Management. Under the Graph Template Selection box, select the graph template that you want to apply to the graph and click Save. If this is a new graph or the graph and graph template contains an equal number of graph items, the graph template will be automatically applied. If number of graph items varies from the graph to the target graph template, you will be prompted with a warning that your graph will be changed.</p>
<p>Once the template is applied to the graph, you will notice that you can only change values for the fields that you checked Use Per-Graph Value for. You will also notice a new box, called Graph Item Inputs. This is where you can specify values for the graph items inputs that you defined in the graph template. The values specified here will be applied to each graph item tied to the graph item input.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Any time a change is made to the graph template, it will be automatically propagated to the graphs attached to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="walkthrough-my-first-graph-template">Walkthrough: My First Graph Template</h4>
<p>Now let's generate the <strong>Graph Template</strong> for those already generated Data Templates. Please go to <strong>Graph Templates</strong> and <strong>Add</strong> a new one:</p>
<p><img src="images/graph-templates.png" alt="Graph Template" /></p>
<p>Now you have to fill in some global parameters:</p>
<p><img src="images/graph-templates-new1.png" alt="Graph Template New" /></p>
<p>on the lower part of the page, please fill in:</p>
<p><img src="images/graph-templates-new2.png" alt="Graph Template New 2" /></p>
<p>and <strong>Create</strong> to see:</p>
<p><img src="images/graph-templates-new3.png" alt="Graph Template New 3" /></p>
<p>Now let's add some Graph Template Items. They will specify, which Data Sources defined by some Data Template should be displayed on the Graph. Please click Add as shown on the last image:</p>
<p><img src="images/graph-templates-item1.png" alt="Graph Template Items 1" /></p>
<p>Now click Save to see:</p>
<p><img src="images/graph-templates-item1s.png" alt="Graph Template Items 1" /></p>
<p>I always appreciate some nice legends to see the numbers for e.g. maximum, average and last value. There's a shortcut for this:</p>
<p><img src="images/graph-templates-item2.png" alt="Graph Template Items" /></p>
<p>Press Save to see three legend items created in one step!</p>
<p><img src="images/graph-templates-item2s.png" alt="Graph Template Items 2" /></p>
<p>Now let's turn to the second data source. This works very much the same way. So see all four images in sequence:</p>
<p><img src="images/graph-templates-item3.png" alt="Graph Template Items 3" /></p>

<p><img src="images/graph-templates-item4s.png" alt="Graph Template Items 4s" /></p>
<p>Please scroll down to the bottom of the page and Save your whole work.</p>
<p>Now, you may add this new Graph Template to any hosts that responds to those udp OIDs. But in this case, please wait a moment. Let's first proceed to the Host Templates and use this new Graph template for our first own Host Template.</p>
<h2 id="host-templates">Host Templates</h2>
<p>Host templates in Cacti serve a different purpose then data and graph templates. Instead of abstracting the fields of a host, a host template allows you to associate graph templates and data queries with a given host type. This way when you assign a host template to a host, all of the relevant graphs to that host type are only one click away from the user.</p>
<h3 id="adding-a-host-template">Adding a Host Template</h3>
<p>To create a new host template in Cacti, select the Host Templates option under the Templates heading. Once on that screen, click Add on the right. Type a unique name for the host template and click the Create button. You will be redirected back to the edit page with the Associated Graph Templates and Associated Data Queries boxes. These two boxes allow you to associate certain graph templates or data queries with the host template. Simply select something from the dropdown menu and click Add to associate it with your host template.</p>
<p><img src="images/device-template.png" alt="Adding a Host Template" /></p>
<h3 id="walkthrough-my-first-host-template">Walkthrough: My First Host Template</h3>
<p>The next task is creating a new <strong>Host Template</strong>. Switch over to <strong>Host Templates</strong> and <strong>Add</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="images/device-template-add.png" alt="Add Host Template" /></p>
<p>and fill in the name of this new Template:</p>
<p><img src="images/device-template-new.png" alt="Add Host Template New" /></p>
<p>Now you'll find two sections added. First, let's deal with <strong>Associated Graph Templates</strong>. The Add <strong>Graph template</strong> select box holds all defined Graph Templates. Select the one we've just created</p>
<p><img src="images/device-template-new-gt.png" alt="Host Template Associate Graph Template" /></p>
<p>and Add it:</p>
<p><img src="images/device-template-new-gts.png" alt="Host Template Associate Graph Template 2" /></p>
<p>Next, let's add the Data Query already selected above:</p>
<p><img src="images/device-template-new-dqs.png" alt="Host Template - Data Query" /></p>
<h2 id="import-templates">Import Templates</h2>
<p>Assume, you're searching for a specific set of templates to monitor a special type of device. Apart from designing templates from scratch, there's a good chance to find a solution in the <a href="http://forums.cacti.net/forum-12.html">Scripts and Templates Forum</a>. The set of templates is usually provided as a single XML file holding all required definitions for a data template and a graph template. Depending on the goal of the original author, he/she may have provided a <strong>Device Template</strong> as well as part of this XML file. Note that after you <strong>Import Templates</strong>, you may also have to copy a Resource XML file to the appropriate &lt;path_cacti&gt;/resource directory, and a script to the &lt;path_cacti&gt;/scripts directory. However, also note that in the current version of Cacti, <strong>Packages</strong> are now importable as well. When you import a <strong>Package</strong> all of the required additional file changes will also be accommodated. We will discuss <strong>Packages</strong> later in the documentation.</p>

<p>If the XML file was downloaded, simply select that file from the Downloads location on your local system. Cacti no longer supports pasting the XML into the browser window.</p>
<p>Please pay attention the the <code>Data Source Profile</code> field. By default, cacti will attempt to use your default <strong>Data Source Profile</strong>. However, you can change that at import time to use an alternate <strong>Data Source Profile</strong> or even the one from the <strong>Template</strong> itself, if it includes one.</p>
<p>Also, not that if you have made local modification to an earlier version of a <strong>Graph Template</strong>, and wish to fully migrate to the new <strong>Graph Template</strong> for all your existing <strong>Graphs</strong>, please select <code>Remove Orphaned Graph Items</code>. Otherwise, your <strong>Graphs</strong> will look awkward in the end. This should not be a problem for new Imports.</p>
<p>It's also important to <code>Preview</code> the <strong>Template</strong> imports to access the impact that the import will have on existing database object. In earlier versions of Cacti, you were unable to determine what would actually change. However, in the current and future versions of Cacti, you will be able to see all local modifications when performing a <code>Preview</code> prior to <code>Importing</code>.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, for a single OID based template, <strong>Importing</strong> the <strong>Template</strong> is all that will be required. However, for a script based template, the author will provide the script that has to be downloaded to the Cacti <code>./scripts</code> directory and for a <strong>Data Query</strong> based <strong>Template</strong>, a second XML file holding the Data Query definitions will have to be downloaded to the appropriate directory under <code>./resources</code>.</p>
<p>When importing templates, Cacti will perform a version check. All XML templates hold the version of the Cacti system that generated this XML set. Cacti will import only, if your current Cacti version equals or is higher than the exporting one.</p>

<p>Now that you know how to import, you may want to know in which way to export as well. Selecting the Export Templates gives</p>

<p>You may select to export a graph template, a data template, a <strong>Device Template</strong> or a <strong>Data Query</strong>. When selecting <code>Include Dependencies</code>, e.g. a <strong>Device Template</strong> will include all referred templates (<strong>Graph Template</strong>, <strong>Data Template</strong>, if defined, <strong>Data Query</strong>). Output may be written to the browser or to a file for uploading.</p>
