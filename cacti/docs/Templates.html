<h1 id="templates">Templates</h1>
<p>The real strength of Cacti is unleashed by using templates. There are five different types of templates with the basic Cacti installation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Device Templates</strong> - Define a Collection of <strong>Graph Templates</strong> and <strong>Data Queries</strong> that belong to a class of <strong>Devices</strong></li>
<li><strong>Graph Templates</strong> - Define how to paint the Graph, it size, legend, left and right Axis and it Canvas</li>
<li><strong>Data Templates</strong> - Define how data is to be stored in the RRDfile and how often to collect that data</li>
<li><strong>Aggregate Templates</strong> - A special class of <strong>Graph Template</strong> that allows you to combine elements from multiple <strong>Graph</strong> of a common Template into one <strong>Graph</strong></li>
<li><strong>Color Templates</strong> - A collection of color rotations to use for <strong>Aggregate Graphs</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>While it is perfectly fine to define all <strong>Data Sources</strong> and <strong>Graphs</strong> without using Templates at all, the burden of this approach is high.</p>
<p>In most installations, there are hundreds if not thousands of <strong>Devices</strong> of the same kind. And there are many similar <strong>Graph Templates</strong>, that span multiple <strong>Device Templates</strong>. For example: Network Traffic information is needed for almost every <strong>Device</strong>. Therefore, the parameters needed to create a traffic RRDfile are defined by the <strong>Data Template</strong>, in this case known as "Interface - Traffic". These definitions are used by all Traffic-related RRDfiles.</p>
<p>The same approach is used for defining <strong>Graph Templates</strong>. This is done only once. And all parameters defined within such a <strong>Graph Template</strong> are copied to all <strong>Graphs</strong> that are created using this Template.</p>
<p>The last type of classic Templates are the <strong>Device Templates</strong>. The purpose of <strong>Device Templates</strong> is to group all <strong>Graph Templates</strong> and <strong>Data Queries</strong> for a given <strong>Device Type</strong>. Example <strong>Device Types</strong> that you might find a <strong>Device Template</strong> for include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cisco Router</li>
<li>Net-SNMP Device</li>
<li>F5 Load Balancer</li>
<li>Windows Device</li>
<li>Local Linux Device</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>So you will make up a <strong>Device Template</strong> e.g. for a specific type of router, switch, host and the like. By assigning the correct <strong>Device Template</strong> to each new <strong>Device</strong>, you'll never forget to create all needed <strong>Graphs</strong>.</p>
<p>There's no need to create all Templates on your own! Apart from the fact, that many common templates are provided out-of-the-box, there's a very simple mechanism to <strong>Import Templates</strong> and to <strong>Export Templates</strong> and more recently to <strong>Import Packages</strong>.</p>
<p>More recent additions to the Cacti family of Templates are the <strong>Aggregate Template</strong> and <strong>Color Template</strong>. The <strong>Aggregate Template</strong> allows you to define a <strong>Graph Template</strong> that can aggregate data from many <strong>Graphs</strong> sharing that Template.</p>
<p>The <strong>Color Template</strong> defines a list of colors that are used in a Round Robin fashion to change the colors seen on the resulting <strong>Aggregate Graphs</strong> to better assist the user in interpreting the resulting <strong>Graph</strong>.</p>
<p>In order to best follow the natural course of Template creation, the remainder of this chapter will explain Templating starting with <strong>Data Templates</strong>, then we will go from there to <strong>Graph Templates</strong>, and from there go to a walk-through of creating both a <strong>Data Template</strong> and <strong>Graph Template</strong>.</p>
<p>From there, we will explain how to create a <strong>Graph</strong> using that newly created set of Templates.</p>
<h2 id="data-templates">Data Templates</h2>
<p>In Cacti, a <strong>Data Template</strong> provides a skeleton for an actual <strong>Data Source</strong>. If you have many <strong>Data Sources</strong> that share most of their characteristics, using a <strong>Data Template</strong> would probably make sense. No change of a <strong>Data Template</strong> is propagated to already existing RRDfiles. But most of them may be changed by using <code>rrdtool tune</code> from command line. Pay attention to not append new <em>Data Source Items</em> to already existing RRDfiles. There's no <code>rrdtool</code> command to achieve this!</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-data-template">Creating a Data Template</h3>
<p>To create a new <strong>Data Template</strong>, select <strong>Data Source</strong> under <code>Console &gt; Templates</code> menu selection and then click Add, which in most cases will be the plus sign in the upper right area of the page.</p>
<p>The first thing you must do is give the template a name. This name has nothing to do with the <strong>Data Source</strong> name, but is what you will use to identify the template throughout Cacti.</p>
<p>Second, you will notice a list of <strong>Data Source</strong> / <strong>Data Source Item</strong> field names with Use Per-Data Source Value check-boxes next to each one. The nice thing about Templates in Cacti is that you can choose whether to template each field on a per-field basis. If you leave the check-box unchecked, every <strong>Data Source</strong> attached to the <strong>Data Template</strong> will inherit its value from the Template. If the check-box is checked, every <strong>Data Source</strong> attached to the *<em>Data Template</em> will contain its own value for that particular field. When generating a real <strong>Data Source</strong>, you will be prompted to fill those non-templated fields.</p>
<p>Not however that if you are using Cacti's <strong>Automation</strong> feature, there is presently no way for you to override these values. So, plan accordingly when engineering your Cacti deployment.</p>

</table>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> For most <strong>Data Templates</strong>, you will should not have to to check the Use Per-Graph Value check-box for the name field. The Templating should handle this just fine. However, the Generic SNMP OID <strong>Data Template</strong> has this value checked to allow you to create Graphs and Data Sources on a piecemeal basis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you are finished filling in values for the <strong>Data Template</strong>, click Create and you will be presented with a screen similar to the image below.</p>
<p><img src="images/data-template.png" alt="Adding a Data Template" /></p>
<h4 id="data-source-items">Data Source Items</h4>
<p>Just like a <strong>Graph</strong>, a <strong>Data Source</strong> can have more than one item. This is useful in situations where a script returns more than piece of data at one time and both need to appear on the same <strong>Graph</strong>. This also applies to <strong>Data Queries</strong>, so you can have a single <strong>Data Template</strong> that contains both Inbound and Outbound Traffic, rather than having to create a separate <strong>Data Template</strong> for each.</p>

The COUNTER data source assumes that the counter never decreases, except when a counter overflows. It is always a whole INTEGER, floating point numbers are invalid. The update function takes the overflow into account. The counter is stored as a per-second rate. When the counter overflows, RRDtool checks if the overflow happened at the 32-bit or 64-bit border and acts accordingly by adding an appropriate value to the result. GAUGE: numbers that are not continuously incrementing, e.g. a temperature reading. Floating point numbers are accepted. ABSOLUTE: counters that are reset upon reading. DERIVE: like COUNTER but without overflow checks</td>

<tr class="odd">

<h4 id="custom-data">Custom Data</h4>
<p>Assuming you selected a <strong>Data Input Method</strong> on the previous screen, you should now be presented with a <strong>Custom Data</strong> form. It will show a single line for every single parameter required for that very <strong>Data Input Method</strong>. This is how the <strong>Data Source</strong> connects to the <strong>Data Input Method</strong> to provide all run time parameters.</p>
<p>Each <strong>Custom Data</strong> field is per-field Templatable as all of the other <strong>Data Source</strong> fields are. Even if you select the Use Per-Data Source Value check-box, it might be useful to specify a value that will be used as an "initial value" for any <strong>Data Source</strong> using the <strong>Data template</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="applying-data-templates-to-data-sources">Applying Data Templates to Data Sources</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When changing parameters of a <strong>Data Template</strong>, existing RRDfiles will not be changed automatically. If this is required, you will have to apply <code>rrdtool tune</code> command to any related RRDfile manually.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Applying a <strong>Data Template</strong> to a <strong>Data Source</strong> is a very simple process. The first thing you must do is select the <strong>Data Source</strong> you want to apply the template to under <strong>Data Sources</strong>. Under the <strong>Data Template</strong> Actions drop-down, select the <strong>Data Template</strong> that you want to apply to the <strong>Data Source</strong> and click Save. Though this should be very rare in modern Cacti instances, it was fairly common before Cacti's Templating system matured.</p>
<p>Once a Template is applied to a Data Source, you will notice that you can only change values for the fields that you checked Use Per-Data Source Value for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Now any time a change is made to the <strong>Data Template</strong>, it will be automatically propagated to the <strong>Data Sources</strong> attached to it. However, as previously stated, changes to a <strong>Data Template</strong> that involve changes to the <strong>Data Source Items</strong>, will not be automatically applied to those same <strong>Data Sources</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="graph-templates">Graph Templates</h2>
<p>In Cacti, a <strong>Graph Template</strong> provides a skeleton for an actual <strong>Graph</strong>. If you have many <strong>Graphs</strong> that share most of their characteristics, using a <strong>Graph Template</strong> makes perfect sense. After a <strong>Graph</strong> is attached to a particular <strong>Graph Template</strong>, all changes made to the <strong>Graph Template</strong> will propagate out to all of its <strong>Graphs</strong>, unless Use Per-Graph Value has been checked.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-graph-template">Creating a Graph Template</h3>
<p>To create a new <strong>Graph Template</strong>, select <strong>Graph</strong> unser <code>Console &gt; Templates</code> menu selection, then click Add normally the plus sign in the upper right corner of the <strong>Graph Template</strong> interface.</p>
<p>The first thing you must do is give the <strong>Graph Template</strong> a name. This name has nothing to do with the graph title, but is what you will use to identify the <strong>Graph Template</strong> throughout Cacti. Second, you will notice a list of graph field names with Use Per-Graph Value check-boxes next to each one. The nice thing about Templates in Cacti is that you can choose whether to template each field on a per-field basis. If you leave the check-box unchecked, every <strong>Graph</strong> owned by the <strong>Graph Template</strong> will inherit its value from the Template. If the check-box is checked, every <strong>Graph</strong> owned by <strong>Graph Template</strong> will have its own value for that particular field.</p>

<h3 id="auto-scaling-options-explained">Auto-scaling Options Explained</h3>
<p>Relative to Auto-scale Options, the RRDtool graph manual says:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limits [-u|--upper-limit value] [-l|--lower-limit value] [-r|--rigid] By default the graph will be auto-scaling so that it will adjust the y-axis to the range of the data. You can change this behavior by explicitly setting the limits. The displayed y-axis will then range at least from lower-limit to upper-limit. Auto-scaling will still permit those boundaries to be stretched unless the rigid option is set.</li>
<li>[-A|--alt-autoscale] Sometimes the default algorithm for selecting the y-axis scale is not satisfactory. Normally the scale is selected from a predefined set of ranges and this fails miserably when you need to graph something like "260 + 0.001 * sin(x)". This option calculates the minimum and maximum y-axis from the actual minimum and maximum data values. Our example would display slightly less than "260-0.001" to slightly more than "260+0.001".</li>
<li>[-J|--alt-autoscale-min] Where "--alt-autoscale" will modify both the absolute maximum AND minimum values, this option will only affect the minimum value. The maximum value, if not defined on the command line, will be 0. This option can be useful when graphing router traffic when the WAN line uses compression, and thus the throughput may be higher than the WAN line speed.</li>
<li>[-M|--alt-autoscale-max] Where "--alt-autoscale" will modify both the absolute maximum AND minimum values, this option will only affect the maximum value. The minimum value, if not defined on the command line, will be 0. This option can be useful when graphing router traffic when the WAN line uses compression, and thus the throughput may be higher than the WAN line speed.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are finished filling in values for the <strong>Graph Template</strong>, click Create and you will be presented with a page similar to the image below. The example below is from a completed Traffic Graph Template.</p>
<p>In this first image, you can see what elements will be painted on the <strong>Graph</strong> Canvas. They are represented by <strong>LINEX</strong>, <strong>AREA</strong> and <strong>STACK</strong> elements. The <strong>Graph Items</strong> listed as <strong>GPRINT</strong> and <strong>COMMENT</strong> appear in the Legend Area of the <strong>Graph</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Graph Input Items</strong> are the Cacti names for the Data Sources that appear on the <strong>Graph</strong> as well as other items that can be substituted during <strong>Graph</strong> Creation.</p>
<p>The <code>Multiple Instances</code> field is a parameter to let Cacti know that it should allow you to create more than one <strong>Graph</strong> per <strong>Device</strong> using the <strong>Graph Template</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="images/graph-template.png" alt="Adding a Graph Template" /></p>
<p>The <strong>Common Options</strong> are options that most every <strong>Graph Template</strong> included. The <strong>Scaling Options</strong> are also very common, but related to <strong>Graph</strong> scaling only.</p>
<p><img src="images/graph-template-options1.png" alt="Adding a Graph Template Options" /></p>
<p>The <strong>Grid Options</strong>, <strong>Axis Options</strong>, and <strong>Legend Options</strong> are must less common but are available in Cacti should you choose to use them.</p>

<h4 id="graph-items">Graph Items</h4>
<p>The first thing you should do is create <strong>Graph Items</strong> for a <strong>Graph Template</strong>, just like for a stand alone <strong>Graph</strong>. One difference you will notice is that the <strong>Data Sources</strong> drop-down will contain a list of <strong>Data Template</strong> items rather than <strong>Data Source Items</strong>. It is important that Cacti can make this association here, so that Cacti doesn't have to make unnecessary assumptions later.</p>

<h3 id="applying-graph-templates-to-graphs">Applying Graph Templates to Graphs</h3>
<p>Applying a <strong>Graph Template</strong> to an existing <strong>Graph</strong> is a very simple process, though very uncommon in a modern Cacti install. The first thing you must do is select the <strong>Graph</strong> you want to apply the template to under <strong>Graph Management</strong>. Under the <strong>Graph Template</strong> Action drop-down, select the <strong>Graph Template</strong> that you want to apply to the <strong>Graph</strong> and click Save. If this is a new <strong>Graph</strong> or the <strong>Graph</strong> and <strong>Graph Template</strong> contain an equal number of <strong>Graph Items</strong>, the **Graph Template" will be automatically applied. If number of <strong>Graph Items</strong> varies from the <strong>Graph</strong> to the target <strong>Graph Template</strong>, you will be prompted with a warning that your <strong>Graph</strong> will be changed, and not always for the better.</p>
<p>Once the <strong>Graph Template</strong> is applied to the existing <strong>Graph</strong>, you will notice that you can only change values for the fields that you checked Use Per-Graph Value for. You will also notice a new box, called <strong>Graph Item Inputs</strong>. This is where you can specify values for the <strong>Graph Item Inputs</strong> that you defined in the <strong>Graph Template</strong>. The values specified here will be applied to each <strong>Graph Item</strong> tied to the <strong>Graph Item Input</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="device-templates">Device Templates</h2>
<p><strong>Device Templates</strong> in Cacti, often times referred to as Host Templates serve as a way to group a set of common <strong>Graph Templates</strong> and <strong>Data Queries</strong> to <strong>Devices</strong> of a certain class, say a Cisco Router or Linux host using Net-SNMP. It really accelerates the deployment of a Cacti system across and enterprise of Devices.</p>
<h3 id="adding-a-device-template">Adding a Device Template</h3>
<p>To create a new <strong>Device Template</strong> in Cacti, select the *<em>Device</em> option under the <code>Console &gt; Templates</code> menu selection. Once on that page, click Add on the right. Type a unique name for the *<em>Device Template</em> and click the Create button. You will be redirected back to the edit page with the <code>Associated Graph Templates</code> and <code>Associated Data Queries</code> forms empty. These two forms allow you to associate <strong>Graph Templates</strong> and/or <strong>Data Queries</strong> with the <strong>Device Template</strong>. Simply select something from the drop-down menu and click Add to associate it with your <strong>Device Template</strong>.</p>
<p>In the case below, we show the Net-SNMP <strong>Device Template</strong>. Note the variety of Graph Templates and Data Queries available for this Class of <strong>Devices</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="images/device-template.png" alt="Adding a Host Template" /></p>
<h2 id="import-templates">Import Templates</h2>
<p>Assume, you're searching for a specific set of templates to monitor a special type of device. Apart from designing templates from scratch, there's a good chance to find a solution in the <a href="http://forums.cacti.net/forum-12.html">Scripts and Templates Forum</a>. The set of templates is usually provided as a single XML file holding all required definitions for a data template and a graph template. Depending on the goal of the original author, he/she may have provided a <strong>Device Template</strong> as well as part of this XML file. Note that after you <strong>Import Templates</strong>, you may also have to copy a Resource XML file to the appropriate &lt;path_cacti&gt;/resource directory, and a script to the &lt;path_cacti&gt;/scripts directory. However, also note that in the current version of Cacti, <strong>Packages</strong> are now importable as well. When you import a <strong>Package</strong> all of the required additional file changes will also be accommodated. We will discuss <strong>Packages</strong> later in the documentation.</p>

<p>If the XML file was downloaded, simply select that file from the Downloads location on your local system. Cacti no longer supports pasting the XML into the browser window.</p>
<p>Please pay attention the the <code>Data Source Profile</code> field. By default, cacti will attempt to use your default <strong>Data Source Profile</strong>. However, you can change that at import time to use an alternate <strong>Data Source Profile</strong> or even the one from the <strong>Template</strong> itself, if it includes one.</p>
<p>Also, not that if you have made local modification to an earlier version of a <strong>Graph Template</strong>, and wish to fully migrate to the new <strong>Graph Template</strong> for all your existing <strong>Graphs</strong>, please select <code>Remove Orphaned Graph Items</code>. Otherwise, your <strong>Graphs</strong> will look awkward in the end. This should not be a problem for new Imports.</p>
<p>It's also important to <code>Preview</code> the <strong>Template</strong> imports to access the impact that the import will have on existing database object. In earlier versions of Cacti, you were unable to determine what would actually change. However, in the current and future versions of Cacti, you will be able to see all local modifications when performing a <code>Preview</code> prior to <code>Importing</code>.</p>
<p>In the image below, you can see the output of a <code>Preview</code> of the Cisco WLC 5520 <strong>Device Template</strong>. When Previewing, no changes are actually made ot your Cacti system.</p>

<p>As mentioned previously, for a single OID based template, <strong>Importing</strong> the <strong>Template</strong> is all that will be required. However, for a script based template, the author will provide the script that has to be downloaded to the Cacti <code>./scripts</code> directory and for a <strong>Data Query</strong> based <strong>Template</strong>, a second XML file holding the Data Query definitions will have to be downloaded to the appropriate directory under the <code>./resource</code> directory.</p>
<p>When importing templates, Cacti will perform a version check. All XML templates hold the version of the Cacti system that generated this XML set. Cacti will import only, if your current Cacti version equals or is higher than the exported one.</p>
<h2 id="export-templates">Export Templates</h2>
<p>Now that you know how to import, you may want to know in which way to export as well. Selecting the Export Templates gives</p>

<p>You may select to export a graph template, a data template, a <strong>Device Template</strong> or a <strong>Data Query</strong>. When selecting <code>Include Dependencies</code>, e.g. a <strong>Device Template</strong> will include all referred templates (<strong>Graph Template</strong>, <strong>Data Template</strong>, if defined, <strong>Data Query</strong>). Output may be written to the browser or to a file for uploading.</p>
