<h1 id="cacti-trees">Cacti Trees</h1>
<h2 id="trees">Trees</h2>
<p>A <strong>Tree</strong> can be thought of as a hierarchical way of organizing your graphs. Each <strong>Tree</strong> consists of zero or more branches that contain leaf nodes such as <strong>Graphs</strong>, <strong>Devices</strong> and <strong>Sites</strong>. It's a very powerful way of organizing your <strong>Graphs</strong>.</p>
<p>Below we can see the current <strong>Trees</strong> we have setup on our Cacti server. To get to this screen click <code>Console &gt; Management &gt; Trees</code>.</p>
<p>From this page you can add or remove <strong>Trees</strong> as required.</p>
<p><img src="images/trees.png" alt="Tree Management Page" /></p>
<p>Below is how a <strong>Tree</strong> is displayed in <strong>Graph View</strong>. We can see the <strong>Device</strong> that is being monitored - clicking on this <strong>Device</strong> will result in seeing all of the <strong>Graph</strong> data generated for the <strong>Device</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-tree">Creating a Tree</h2>
<p>To create a new tree simply click the Add button (+) on the top right hand corner and enter a name for your <strong>Tree</strong>. After the tree has been created you will see the below page where you are able to add <strong>Devices</strong> to the <strong>Tree</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="images/tree-options.png" alt="Tree Options" /></p>
<p>To add devices to the new tree simply drag an available device to the tree and it will be added to the tree. Cacti currently supports four <code>Sort Types</code>, which can be either inherited, of left to the author to define inheritance and at what level. See the image below for a visual representation of how Tree Sorting is accomplished.</p>

<p>End users will not be able to view the <strong>Tree</strong> or it's Graphs until you publish it. To edit a <strong>Tree</strong>, you will be required to lock it for your use. The locking is designed to prevent multiple users from editing a <strong>Tree</strong> simultaneously.</p>
<p>When a Tree is locked, you can drag &amp; drop the <strong>Sites</strong>, <strong>Devices</strong> and <strong>Graphs</strong> over to the Tree menu. To add a 'Root Branch', simply press the button to do so, once you have Root Branches, you may right click on the to create sub-branches on the Tree.</p>
<p>When you single click on a <strong>Site</strong>, the <strong>Devices</strong>, and <strong>Graphs</strong> associated with that <strong>Site</strong> should appear in their respective sections. You can also type into the Search fields above the various sections to drill into them. You can also shift-click and control-click on the objects within a section to drag &amp; drop multiple objects at one time.</p>
<p>Don't forget to unlock your <strong>Tree</strong> before finishing your editing session.</p>
