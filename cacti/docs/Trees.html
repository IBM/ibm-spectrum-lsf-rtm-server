<p>This section will describe <strong>Tree</strong> management in Cacti.</p>
<p>Trees in cacti are used to place graphs and devices on trees are organized by name.</p>
<p>Below we can see the current trees we have setup on our cacti server. To get to this screen click <code>console &gt;&gt; managment &gt;&gt; trees</code>.</p>
<p>From this page you can add or remove trees as you need</p>

<p>Below is how a tree is displayed in graph view. We can see the device that is being monitored - clicking on this device will result in seeing all of the graph data generated for the device.</p>

<p>To create a new tree simply click the + on the top right hand corner and enter a name for your tree. After the tree has been created you will see the below page where you are able to add devices to the tree.</p>

<p>To add devices to the new tree simply drag an avaliable device to the tree and it will be added to the tree</p>
