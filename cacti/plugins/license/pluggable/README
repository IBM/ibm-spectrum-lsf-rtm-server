    service to RTM. e.g. DSLS, LM-X, ....

----[ Installation

    For local installation, DSLS/LM-X example will be installed to
    <RTM_TOP>/rtm/lic/etc/pluggable RTM Poller package by Installation Guide.

    Under RTM Remote Poller mode:
     - Install PHP(>=5.3) with php-mysql extension.
     - Install RTM Poller package by Installation Guide.
     - Copy <RTM_TOP>/rtm/lic/etc/pluggable from local to remote node
     - Configure <RTM_TOP>/rtm/lic/etc/pluggable/include/config.php
       like <RTM_TOP>/cacti/include/config.php

----[ Before Get Start

     Import DSLS/LM-X Poller definition by:
       #mysql cacti < <RTM_TOP>/rtm/lic/etc/pluggable/lm_install.sql

	 Configure DSLS/LM-X command path (<path_to_dsls> or <path_to_lm-x>) by:
	   - RTM_Web->Console-> Management->Managers->(Click DSLS or LM-X)
	     ->(Edit)License Manager Binary Path->Save
       - Or copy DSLS command 'DSLicSrv into RTM_TOP/dsls/bin,
          copy LM-X command 'lmxendutil' into RTM_TOP/lmx/bin/.
